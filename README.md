# 🚧 Pothole Detection Project using YOLOv8

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on automatic detection of road potholes using deep learning and computer vision techniques. It uses a YOLOv8 object detection model to identify potholes in road images and videos, helping improve road safety and maintenance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect potholes from images and videos
- Use a fast and accurate deep learning model
- Support real-time or near real-time detection
- Provide an easy-to-use Python-based application

---

## 🧠 Technology Stack
- Python  
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)  
- OpenCV  
- PyTorch  
- Git Large File Storage (LFS)

## 🏗️ Project Structure
Pothole-Detection-Project/
- app.py – Main application file  
- best.pt – Trained YOLOv8 model (stored using Git LFS)  
- annotated_image.jpg – Sample output image  
- pot1.jpeg, pot2.jpg – Sample input images  
- runs/ – YOLO output results  
- yolo/ – YOLO configuration files  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Input road images or videos are given to the system  
2. YOLOv8 processes the input data  
3. Potholes are detected and marked using bounding boxes  
4. Output is displayed or saved for analysis  

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install required packages:

2. Run the application:

Make sure `best.pt` is in the same folder as `app.py`.

---

## 📦 Model File Note
The trained model file `best.pt` is large and is managed using Git Large File Storage (Git LFS).

To download the model after cloning:
